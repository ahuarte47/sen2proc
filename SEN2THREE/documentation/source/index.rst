Sen2Three: Sentinel 2 Level 3 Spatio-Temporal Synthesis Processor, Version 1.2.0.

.. _Sen2Cor: http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/sen2cor

Sen2Three is a level 3 processor for the Spatio-Temporal Synthesis of bottom of atmosphere corrected level 2a images,
as they are generated by the Sen2Cor_ application. Sen2Three takes time series of level 2a images of certain geographical
areas (tiles) as input and generates a synthetic output image by replacing step by step all "bad" pixels of previous
input images with the collocated "good" pixels of scenes following in time.
